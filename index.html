            My role evolved throughout my time at Kiteworks; to think more

            fit as much as ease of use, and most importantly, to collaborate
            effectively with teams across the organization and the world.

            I joined Swipp about four months before launching to the world; the
            goal was to design the product, particularly the mobile apps. I left
            the company after months of hard work, more than a few product
            pivots, foosball tournaments, you know, startup stuff.

          <p>
            Digital products are alive even if we know they are not based on
            organic matter; they are constantly evolving based on the people who
            work on them and their ability to turn problem insights into
            products that solve these problems more efficiently to satisfy and
            delight users and customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I leverage all kinds of methods to perform qualitative and
            quantitative analysis to measure for success.

          <p>
            Digital products must be intuitive, meet the user where and how the
            user expects them and get out of the way when they are no longer
            needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I use effective tools to convert the product requirements into
            simple and elegant user interface systems:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mind maps to capture the requirements of stakeholders.</li>
            <li>Flow chart diagrams to map user flows using Figjam.</li>
            <li>UI prototype using Figma or Adobe XD.</li>
            <li>
              Web UI components using Visual Studio Code + HTML, CSS, JS and
              React.

            The first impressions matter, and most of this sentiment is derived
            from the form and aesthetics of the product.
          </p>
          <p>
            I use tools to achieve high resolution and detail so that users feel

            Sometimes problems come knocking at the door, but even in those
            cases, it’s rarely precisely as the stake-holders describe it; it’s
            almost like a detective work where there are personas and
            motivations involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            I focus on getting to the root of problems to understand the impact,
            consequences, and motivations.

            Genuine respect and kindness are the best way to get your foot into
            almost anybody’s office. Projects tend to run a lot smoother when
            the relevant stakeholders are included and communicated about the
            initiatives and progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            I go out there and talks to internal and external stake-holders and
            end-users to get a first-hand understanding of the feasibility of
            the design options.

            I understand that product design and development is a marathon and
            not a sprint. Life-Work balance is a priority to create an
            environment where creativity and productivity can thrive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like products, the people behind them are always evolving; the goal
            is to create a virtuous cycle where talent, health, and peace can
            expand.
