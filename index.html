          <p>
            Digital products are alive even if we know they are not based on
            organic matter, they are always evolving based on the people that
            work on them, and these people's ability to turn problem's insights
            into products that solve these problems more efficiently to satisfy
            and delight users and customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chris leverages all kinds of methods to research, document journeys,
            personas, capture analytics, A/B testing and measure success.

          <p>
            Digital products must be intuitive, meet the user where and how the
            user expects it and get out of the way when is no longer needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chris uses very powerful tools to convert the product requirements
            into simple and elegant user interface systems:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mind maps to capture the requirements from stake-holders.</li>
            <li>Flow chart diagrams to map user flows using Figjam.</li>
            <li>UI prototype using Figma or Adobe XD.</li>
            <li>
              Web UI components using Visual Studio Code + HTML, CSS, JS and
              React.
            </li>
          </ul>

            The first impressions matter and most of this sentiment is derived
            from the form and aesthetics of the product.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chris uses tools to achieve a high-level of resolution and detail so
            that users feel constantly engaged.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>UI components library using Figma or Adobe XD.</li>

            Sometimes problems come knocking at the door, but even in those
            cases it’s rarely exactly as the stake-holders describe it, it’s
            almost like a detective work where there are personas and
            motivations involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chris focuses on getting to the root of problems, to understand the
            impact, consequences, and the motivations involved.

            Genuine respect and kindness are the best way to get your foot into
            almost anybody’s office. When the relevant stake-holders are
            included and communicated about the initiatives and progress,
            projects tend to run a lot smoother.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chris goes out there and talks to internal and external
            stake-holders as well as to end-users to get a first-hand
            understanding of the feasibility of the design options.

            Chris understands that product design and development is a marathon
            and not a sprint. Life-Work balance is a priority to create an
            environment where creativity and productivity can thrive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like products, the people behind them are always evolving, the goal
            is to create a virtuous cycle where talent, health and peace can
            expand.

            The role that Chris has played evolved throughout his time at
            Kiteworks; to think more systematically, to wage usability and
            security, to care about market-fit as much as ease of use, but most
            importantly to collaborate effectively with teams across the
            organization and the world.

            left the company after months of hard work, more than a few product
            pivots, foosball tournaments, you know, startup stuff…

            When Talenthouse invited Chris to help design a platform for the

            he got his very own game-changing opportunity. It was his first
            chance in the United States of America, and he was about to grab it
            by the horns…
