              <p>
                Designers needed a library of UI components to be reused
                whenever they wanted to design for a workflow. The UI components
                should also be easy to update.
              </p>
              <p>
                Developers needed a library of UI components in all their states
                to build an exact replica, so that any component can be reused
                thoughout the product graphical user interfaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                The branding guidelines have been recently updated, and the
                product look and feel should leverage those guidelines.
              </p>
              <h4>Product definition</h4>
              <p>
                Kiteworks is a white-label B2B platform that can be partially
                re-branded without affecting accessibility. Being a white-label
                product implies the neutrality and simplicity to harmonize with
                any brand look and feel or be used out of the box without
                customization.
              </p>
              <p>
                A project to improve the user experience of the admin console
                will serve as the first product to be built using the new UI
                components' library. The goal is to analyze every detail to
                optimize the look and feel of each and, as a result, the overall
                style of the library.
              </p>
              <p>
                The components design will be leveraged from the existing look
                and feel of the end-user UI, given its adoption in recent years.

              <p>
                The design and development teams met a few of times to express
                their needs and ideas to approach the solution using different
                tools or styles.
              </p>
              <p>
                The design team decided to use the Adobe XD components design
                features to produce all the different states and compose the new
                admin pages. To store the library and enable the developers to
                inspect them for implementation details, the team decided to
                continue using Zeplin.
              </p>
              <h4>Team alignment</h4>
              <p>
                The teams agreed to buy a React template with basic pages and
                components included as a baseline to adapt to the new style and
                custom components.
              </p>
              <p>
                The design team frequently met with the front-end team to ensure
                the progress met everyone's needs when designing and building
                different kinds of pages.
              </p>

              <p>
                The first step I took was to capture screenshots of each page of
                the Admin UI to identify all the different kinds of UI
                components used throughout the Admin UI in context.
              </p>
              <p>
                The engineering team had a plan to start with the form type of
                components. Therefore, I focus on developing those first and
                then the tables.

                The first draft of the components was a replica of the original

                feel and minor improvements in the behavior throughout its
                states. The goal was to validate that the component's unique
                styles would work well together.

                When building each component from the ground up, the goal was to
                break it down to its fundamental parts and reuse as many rules
                across segments.

                More elaborated components like tables were the most complicated
                due to their many possibilities for types of data and behavior
                needs, e.g., Some need a checkbox. In contrast, others need to
                expand and collapse control, but all are required to display
                data in a table format, optimizing for large amounts of data and
                quick access to controls.

                The final design results from the close collaboration with my
                design teammates on every detail, from the font size, margins,
                and colors of each component to the information architecture and
                usability across the system.

                As Steve Jobs famously said, "Real artists ship" from this
                perspective, the design and front-end teams were enabled to
                produce what they needed using the components and the
                documentation provided.
              </p>
              <p>
                The admin UI redesign was a success across the organization and
                end-users; the library is ready to be extended to other
                Kiteworks user interfaces.
              </p>
              <h4>Learnings</h4>
              <p>
                Creating a library of components and a design system, for that
                matter, implies thinking in terms of simplicity, extensibility,
                usability, relationship with other elements, different states,
                etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                The system is a never-ending project because the gaps in
                production and communication can constantly be improved.
              </p>
              <h4>Future iterations</h4>
              <p>
                The combination of Adobe XD for design and Zeplin for a handout
                to a developer was not very efficient due to the need to
                maintain two sources of truth. By the time we finished this
                project, Figma was starting to become the standard for UI
                design, so the team looked into the migration hoping to have
                only one source of truth for UI design and components and
                handing it over to developers.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm investing in learning Figma, especially now that the latest
                version in May 2022 includes powerful features to significantly
                reduce the number of versions of components like buttons, toats,
                etc. and support for responsive design. Figjam is also an
                excellent tool for brainstorming and documenting workflows.
