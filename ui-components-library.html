          <h4>Identify user / business needs</h4>
          <p>
            Designers needed a library of UI components to be reused every time
            they wanted to design for a workflow. The UI components should also
            be easy to update.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developers needed a library of UI components in all their states to
            build an exact replica of those components, so that any component
            can be re-used thoughout the product graphical user interfaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            The branding guidelines had been recently updated and the product
            look and feel should leverage those guidelines.
          </p>
          <h4>Product definition</h4>
          <p>
            Kiteworks is a white-label B2B platform that can be partially
            re-branded without affectinig accessibility. Being a white-label
            product implies the neutrality and simplicity to harmonize with any
            brand look and feel or to be used out of the box without any
            customization.
          </p>
          <p>
            A project to improve the user experience of the admin console will
            serve as the first product to be built using the new UI components'
            library.
          </p>
          <p>
            The components design will be leveraged from the existing look and
            feel of the end user UI, given its adoption in recent years.

          <h4>Brainstorm</h4>
          <p>
            The design and developement teams met a couple of times to express
            their needs and their ideas to approach the solution using different
            tools or styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design team decided to use the Adobe XD components design
            features to produce all the different states and compose the new
            admin pages. To store the library and enable the developers to
            inspect them for implementation details, the team decided to
            continue using Zeplin.
          </p>
          <h4>Team alignment</h4>
          <p>
            The teams agreeed on buying a React template with basic pages and
            components included as a baseline to be adapted to the new style and
            custom components.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design team met frequently with the front-end team to make sure
            the progress was meeting everyone's needs when designing and
            building diferent kinds of pages.
