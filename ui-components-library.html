          <h4>Identify user / business needs</h4>
          <p>
            Designers needed a library of UI components to be reused every time
            they wanted to design for a workflow. The UI components should also
            be easy to update.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developers needed a library of UI components in all their states to
            build an exact replica of those components, so that any component
            can be re-used thoughout the product graphical user interfaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            The branding guidelines had been recently updated and the product
            look and feel should leverage those guidelines.
          </p>
          <h4>Product definition</h4>
          <p>
            Kiteworks is a white-label B2B platform that can be partially
            re-branded without affectinig accessibility. Being a white-label
            product implies the neutrality and simplicity to harmonize with any
            brand look and feel or to be used out of the box without any
            customization.
          </p>
          <p>
            A project to improve the user experience of the admin console will
            serve as the first product to be built using the new UI components'
            library. The goal is to analyze every component to optimize its look
            and feel of each and as a result, the overall style of the library.
          </p>
          <p>
            The components design will be leveraged from the existing look and
            feel of the end user UI, given its adoption in recent years.

          <h4>Brainstorm</h4>
          <p>
            The design and developement teams met a couple of times to express
            their needs and their ideas to approach the solution using different
            tools or styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design team decided to use the Adobe XD components design
            features to produce all the different states and compose the new
            admin pages. To store the library and enable the developers to
            inspect them for implementation details, the team decided to
            continue using Zeplin.
          </p>
          <h4>Team alignment</h4>
          <p>
            The teams agreeed on buying a React template with basic pages and
            components included as a baseline to be adapted to the new style and
            custom components.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design team met frequently with the front-end team to make sure
            the progress was meeting everyone's needs when designing and
            building diferent kinds of pages.

          <h4>Explorations</h4>
          <p>
            The first step I did was to capture screenshots of each page of the
            Admin UI to identify all the different kinds of UI components used
            thoughout the Admin UI in context.
          </p>
          <p>
            The engineering team had a plan to start with the form type of
            components, therefore I focus on developing those first and then the
            tables.

            The first draft of the components was a replica of the original
            layout only replacing the UI components for the new look and feel
            and minor improvements in the behavior thoughout its states. The
            goal was to validate that the components new style would work well
            together.

            When building each component from the ground up the goal was to
            break it down to its fundamental parts and re-use as many rules as
            possible across components.

            Larger components like tables were the most complicated due to its
            many possibilities for types of data and behavior needs, e.g. Some
            need a checkbox, while others need and expand and collapse control,
            but all needed to display data in a table format, optimizing for
            large amounts of data and quick access to controls.

          <h4>Success metrics</h4>
          <p>
            As Steve Jobs famously said "Real artists ship", from this
            perspective the design and front-end teams were able to produce what
            they needed using the components and the documentation provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            The redesign of the admin was a success across the organization and
            end-users, the library is ready to be extended to other Kiteworks
            user interfaces.
          </p>
          <h4>Learnings</h4>
          <p>
            Creating a library of components and a design system for that matter
            implies to think in terms of simplicity, extensibility, usability,
            relationship with other components, different states, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system is a never ending project because the gaps of production
            and communication can always be improved.
          </p>
          <h4>Future iterations</h4>
          <p>
            The combination of Adobe XD for design and Zeplin for hand out to
            developer was not very efficient due to the need to maintain two
            sources of truth, by the time we were finishing this roject, Figma
            was starting to become the standard for UI design, so the team
            looked into the migration hoping to have only one source of truth
            for UI design, components and hand over to developers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personally I'm investing in learning Figma, specially now that the
            latest version on May 2022 includes powerful features to reduce
            significantly the number of versions of components like buttons,
            toats, etc. as well as support for responsive design. Figjam is also
            a great tool for brainstorming and documenting workflows.
