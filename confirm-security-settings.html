          <h4>Identify user / business needs</h4>
          <p>
            The primary motivation was to protect the Kiteworks organization
            from its customers opening risk exposure, due to missunderstanding
            specific security features, that meant that it was a high-priority
            for the CEO, VP of product, and stock-holders of the company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Customers who were using features in a way that could be impacted,
            needed to know about it to either change or confirm the security
            settings.

          <h4>Product definition</h4>
          <p>
            Framework to inform admins about security settings that could impact
            the risk exposure of their system, including an overlay wizard to
            guide the user over the list of settings and an email campaign to
            inform ahead of time, and when one of the admins confirms a security
            setting.

          <!-- Brainstorming -->
          <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
          <p>
            During the initial brainstorming sessions, the team agreed on the
            overall interaction model of the wizard, that uses an overlay dialog
            to enable the user to complete specific tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time we didn't know the exact settings that were going to be
            targeted, however the requirement from the beggining was to create a
            framework that could contain different levels of risk based on the
            <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss" target="_blank"
              >Common Vulnerability Scoring System</a
            >
            referenced by the Kiteworks security team when reviwing each setting
            in detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later on, the requirements expanded to include an email campaign
            that would prepare the targeted admins ahead of time, guide them
            once it was available, and shared the information among relevan
            admins within each organization.
          </p>

          <!-- User research -->
          <h4>User research</h4>
          <p>
            We identified the customers that were going to be impacted and
            reached out to a handful of those that we already had a cooperation
            relationship, we initially focused on understanding their specific
            motivations to use the settings in such matter.
          </p>

          <!-- Problem / Solution validation -->
          <h4>Problem / Solution validation</h4>
          <p>
            Once we had a prototype, we met again with the same group of admins
            to test the prototype and get their feedback. The goal was to
            identify wheter they think the workflow too aggrasive, if they can
            understand what's expected from them, and if something they expected
            was missing. We met a couple more time after that before release to
            test over the iterations and the further extensions like the email
            campaign.
          </p>

          <!-- Team alignment -->
          <h4>Team alignment</h4>
          <p>
            I held multiple meetings depending on the stage of the project with
            multiple memebers of different teams, once in a while I would bring
            the larger group to inform the progress and discuss contradictory
            opinions from stake-holders. The majority of the sessions were with
            the relevant people in smaller groups.

          <h4>Explorations</h4>
          <p>
            The first version of the prototype showcased the wizard model with a
            couple of different levels of risk associated with two distinct
            settings.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/iteration-on-wizard-0.png"
            alt="First version of prototype"
          />
          <p>
            One of the mechanics that required multiple iterations was around
            the process of confirming a security setting. The goals were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Present succinct information so that admins can make an informed
              security decision.
            </li>
            <li>
              Confirm the identity of the admin who interacted with the security
              setting.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create friction that ensures that the admin is concious about the
              changes applied.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <img
            src="./images/confirm-typing-password.png"
            alt="Early version of confirmation method using password"
          />
          <p>
            One early concept explored was to force the admin to confirm the
            decisdion by entering their password, this was dismissed as
            something too aggresive and not necessary from the security
            perspective.
          </p>

          <h4>Iterations</h4>
          <p>
            The majority of the iterations happened on the wizard interaction
            model and the language, we started with a model of multiple levels
            of risk displayed at once and ended focusing only on 4 settings, all
            of them very high-risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first few iterations focused only on the wizard approach, all
            the components created were new and unique to the wizard.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/iteration-on-wizard-1.png"
            alt="Wizard accordion without reference to existing UI"
          />
          <p>
            The first release of this feature focused on high-risk settings
            only, therefore we only presented one group of settings at
            high-riskand prioritize them top to bottom depending on its score.
            Another early idea was to add contextual information boxes next to
            sensitive settings even if they were not activated so that admins
            can learn about the best practices.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/iteration-on-wizard-2.png"
            alt="Accordion with information boxes in context"
          />
          <p>
            We had some versions where the grouping of the settings would
            simplify one view but overcomplicate others, this version shows a
            badge to recognize the number of settings under each line.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/iteration-on-wizard-3.png"
            alt="List of security settings grouped by type"
          />
          <p>
            When the admin navigates into a group of settings, the accordion
            will allow to display one versus the other and when one is
            completed, it disappears from the wizard.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/iteration-on-wizard-4.png"
            alt="Accordion with warning boxes in context"
          />
          <h4>Final solution</h4>
          <p>
            The wizard landing page explains the admin about the list of
            settings that need attention, shows the context of each setting,
            allows for interaction on a single setting basis so that the log of
            the confirmation is per setting.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/final-wizard-list.png"
            alt="Final wizard top page for list of security settings"
          />
          <p>
            Admins can take two paths on each security setting, they can either
            change the setting to dissengage the risk and save, or they can go
            through the process of confirming the risk navigating over multiple
            friction points to make sure the admin understands what's happening.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/final-change-setting.png"
            alt="Change settings. Setting details without warnig boxes"
          />
          <img
            src="./images/final-confirm-setting.png"
            alt="Confirm risk. Setting details with overlay checkboxes"
          />
          <p>
            When the admin dismisses the wizard, information is presented to put
            some time pressure on the interaction, stressing the urgency of this
            matter.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/final-remind-later.png"
            alt="Modal asking the admin to confirm that wants to exit the wizard"
          />
          <p>
            The same components created in the context of the wizard were also
            extended to the pages where each setting is located, this allows the
            admin to confirm the setting from the context that is familiar with.
          </p>

          <h4>Success metrics</h4>
          <p>
            More than 80% of customers engaged with the interaction and
            completed the workflow, this caused minimal impact in the customer
            support organization, the remaining customers were helped by a
            customer support representative.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are fewer customers out there with potential security
            exposures, and for those remaining now there is a record of someone
            manually confirming the setting in case of a dispute.
          </p>
          <h4>Learnings</h4>
          <p>
            Personally, I learned new cybersecurity concepts and implications, I
            was able to bring a large group of people together in a high-stake
            project to deliver on time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a team, we developed the beggining of a framework to educate the
            admin around the setup of the system, so that is protected. We were
            able to start the library of components for the design system and
            these was the first set of those applied to this UI.
          </p>
          <h4>Future iterations</h4>
          <p>
            The new interaction model used by the wizard could be used for any
            other that required inmidiate and focused attention from the admin,
            at the same time while working on the security feature the same
            stake-holders pushed for the implementation of the "What's new!
            modal to inform admins about the recently installed version."
          </p>
          <img src="./images/what-is-new.png" alt="what's new modal" />

            In a future release a new project to update contacts from the
