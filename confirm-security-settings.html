          <h4>Identify user / business needs</h4>
          <p>
            The primary motivation was to protect the Kiteworks organization
            from its customers' opening risk exposure due to misunderstanding
            specific security features, which meant that it was a high priority
            for the CEO, VP of product, and company stockholders.
          </p>
          <p>
            Customers who were using features in a way that could be impacted
            needed to know about it to either change or confirm the security
            settings.

            Framework to inform admins about security settings that could impact
            the risk exposure of their system, including an overlay wizard to
            guide the user over the list of settings and an email campaign to
            inform ahead of time, and when one of the admins confirms a security
            setting.

          <!-- Brainstorming -->
          <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
          <p>
            During the initial brainstorming sessions, the team agreed on the
            overall interaction model of the wizard that uses an overlay dialog
            to enable the user to complete specific tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Early on the project, we didn't know the exact settings that were
            going to be targeted; however, the requirement from the beginning
            was to create a framework that could contain different levels of
            risk based on the
            <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss" target="_blank"
              >Common Vulnerability Scoring System</a
            >
            referenced by the Kiteworks security team when reviwing each setting
            in detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later on, the requirements expanded to include an email campaign
            that would prepare the targeted admins ahead of time, guide them
            once it was available, and share the information among relevant
            admins within each organization.
          </p>

          <!-- User research -->
          <h4>User research</h4>
          <p>
            We identified the customers that were going to be impacted to reach
            out to a handful we already had a cooperation relationship, we
            initially focused on understanding their specific motivations to use
            the settings in that way.
          </p>

          <!-- Problem / Solution validation -->
          <h4>Problem / Solution validation</h4>
          <p>
            Once we had a prototype, we met again with the same group of admins
            to test the prototype and get their feedback. The goal was to
            identify wheter they think the workflow too aggrasive, if they can
            understand what's expected from them, and if something they expected
            was missing. We met a couple more times after that before the
            release to test over the iterations and the further extensions like
            the email campaign.
          </p>

          <!-- Team alignment -->
          <h4>Team alignment</h4>
          <p>
            I held multiple meetings depending on the stage of the project, with
            multiple memebers of different teams; once in a while, I would bring
            the larger group to inform the progress and discuss contradictory
            opinions from stake-holders. The majority of the sessions were with
            the relevant people in smaller groups.

            The first version of the prototype showcased the wizard model with a
            couple of different levels of risk associated with two distinct
            settings.

          <p class="foot-note">First version of prototype.</p>
          <p>
            One of the interactions that required multiple iterations was around
            the process of confirming a security setting. The goals were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Present succinct information so that admins can make an informed
              security decision.
            </li>
            <li>
              Confirm the identity of the admin who interacted with the security
              setting.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create friction that ensures that the admin is concious of the
              changes applied.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <img
            src="./images/confirm-typing-password.png"
            alt="Early version of confirmation method using password."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">
            Early version of confirmation method using password.
          </p>
          <p>
            One early concept explored was, forcing the admin to confirm the
            decisdion by entering their password; this was dismissed as
            something too aggresive and not necessary from the security
            perspective.
          </p>

          <h4>Iterations</h4>
          <p>
            The majority of the iterations happened on the wizard interaction
            model and the copy writting; we started with a model of multiple
            levels of risk displayed at once and ended focusing only on 4
            settings, all very high-risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first few iterations focused only on the wizard approach; all
            the components created were new and unique to the wizard.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/iteration-on-wizard-1.png"
            alt="Wizard accordion without reference to existing UI."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">
            Wizard accordion without reference to existing UI.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first release of this feature focused on high-risk settings
            only; therefore, we only presented one group of settings at high
            risk and prioritized them top to bottom depending on their score.
            Another early idea was to add contextual information boxes next to
            sensitive settings even if they were not activated so that admins
            could learn about the best practices.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/iteration-on-wizard-2.png"
            alt="Accordion with information boxes in context."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">Accordion with information boxes in context.</p>
          <p>
            We had some versions where the grouping of the settings would
            simplify one view but overcomplicate others; this version shows a
            badge to recognize the number of settings under each line.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/iteration-on-wizard-3.png"
            alt="List of security settings grouped by type."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">List of security settings grouped by type.</p>
          <p>
            When the admin navigates into a group of settings, the accordion
            will allow displaying one versus the other, and when one is
            completed, it disappears from the wizard.
          </p>

          <p class="foot-note">Accordion with warning boxes in context.</p>
          <h4>Final solution</h4>
          <p>
            The wizard landing page explains to the admin the list of settings
            that need attention, shows the context of each setting and allows
            for interaction on a single setting basis so that the confirmation
            log is per setting.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/final-wizard-list.png"
            alt="Final wizard top page for list of security settings."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">
            Final wizard top page for list of security settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Admins can take two paths on each security setting. They can either
            change the setting to disengage the risk and save, or they can go
            through the process of confirming the risk, by navigating over
            multiple friction points to make sure the admin understands what's
            happening.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/final-change-setting.png"
            alt="Change settings. Setting details without warnig boxes."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">

          <p class="foot-note">
            Confirm risk. Setting details with overlay checkboxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the admin dismisses the wizard, information is presented to put
            some time pressure on the interaction, stressing the urgency of this
            matter.
          </p>
          <img

          </p>
          <p>
            The same components created in wizard context were also extended to
            the pages where each setting is located; this allows the admin to
            confirm the setting from the context that she is familiar with.

          <p>
            More than 80% of customers engaged with the interaction and
            completed the workflow; this caused a minimal impact on the customer
            support organization, and as planned a customer support
            representative helped the remaining customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are fewer customers out there with potential security
            exposures, and for those remaining now, there is a record of someone
            manually confirming the setting in case of a dispute.
          </p>
          <h4>Learnings</h4>
          <p>
            I learned new cybersecurity concepts and implications; I was able to
            bring a large group of people together on a high-stake project to
            deliver on time.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a team, we developed the beginning of a framework to educate the
            admin about the system's set up so that it is protected. We were
            able to start the library of components for the design system, and
            the first set of those components is applied to this UI.
          </p>
          <h4>Future iterations</h4>
          <p>
            The new interaction model used by the wizard could be used for any
            other that required immediate and focused attention from the admin;
            at the same time, while working on the security feature, the same
            stakeholders pushed for the implementation of the "What's new! modal
            to inform admins about the recently installed version."
