          <h4>Identify user / business needs</h4>
          <p>
            People in the role of CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) care
            for one thing above else, to protect the organization assets from
            getting on the wrong hands or destroyed, therefore it's very
            important to alert them about potential risks, and present accurate
            and valuable information.
          </p>
          <h4>Product definition</h4>
          <p>
            The main goal is to reach the CISO with urgency to present the
            relevant information and to enable the option to share this alert,
            knowing that the mobile device is the one that people check more
            often and even has ways to push a notification so, we could asume
            the CISO would look into it shortly.

          <!-- Brainstorming -->
          <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
          <p>
            The implementation of the alerts on the mobile app is an extension
            of a feature I collaborated with before, the information displayed
            was the result of ongoing discussions with stake-holders about the
            meaning of risk in an enviroment such as the Kiteworks platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mobile design had to adapt a new view that will only be
            available for some types of users, fortunatelly the mobile main
            navigation had been recently simplified, so this wasn't a problem.
          </p>

          <!-- User research -->
          <h4>User research</h4>
          <p>
            Based on the hypothesis the team met with internal and external
            stake-holders, such as the CEO and other excecutives as well as some
            customers that showed interest on these type of tools before, the
            goal early on was to get insights into their motivations and
            expectations and later on to validate versions of the prototype.
          </p>

          <!-- Problem / Solution validation -->
          <h4>Problem / Solution validation</h4>
          <p>
            The primary question we had was the types of risks that they were
            looking for to see if there is a match or if there is something
            else. Then, the questions were more about the alert we had in mind
            to qualify its merit according to this user.
          </p>

          <!-- Team alignment -->
          <h4>Team alignment</h4>
          <p>
            I served as the link between the team working on the AI to detect
            alerts and the teams working on the mobile apps. Meeting regularly
            with both teams helped everyone to be on the same page.
          </p>
          <p>
            The spec documentation and the prototype helps bring everything and
            everyone together, giving everyone access to the design, the ability
            to ask questions and make comments.

          <h4>Explorations</h4>
          <p>
            In an effort to streamline the information to the user and provide
            her with the ability to act on that information, we thought about
            adding a button to share, however after testing with internal
            stake-holders we discovered that the user needs to see the full
            details about the alert before making the decision to share.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/draft-notification-options.png"
            alt="Idea of expand push notification for options, to see details or share alert."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">
            Idea of expand push notification for options, to see details or
            share alert.
          </p>

          <p>
            When capturing the details that the alert needed to cointain
            including the metadata, it was clear that some repetition could be
            avoided. We also got feedback about a better display of the
            location, to get a better understanding of where the alert was
            triggered.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/draft-alert-details.png"
            alt="Idea of full alert details including the files that triggered the alert."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">
            Idea of full alert details including the files that triggered the
            alert.
          </p>

          <p>
            In an effort to create the tools for the user to find alerts
            quickly, this design shows a dedicated text search field to narrow
            down search results. Turns out that after some testing with internal
            stake-holders we realized that the amount of alerts was going to be
            small and the frequency sparse so a single search filter was enough.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/draft-search-alerts.png"
            alt="Idea of search and filter alerts."

          <p class="foot-note">Idea of search and filter alerts.</p>

          <h4>Iterations</h4>
          <p>
            The idea of filtering as an end goal was correct, so we explored
            ways to simplify the ability to see the query and the filters
            without the cludder of the three text boxes. We did not explore
            further given that more alerts would take time to develop and
            nothing much complicated was going to be needed at that moment.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/iteration-search-filters.png"
            alt="Iteration on the search alerts interaction."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">Iteration on the search alerts interaction.</p>

          <p>
            When thinking about the options for each alert in the context of
            risk management, we explored the type of actions that the CISO would
            want to take on the user who triggered the alert, however given that
            the level of confidence can't be determined on the alerts, we
            decided not to expand on these ideas for the moment.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/iteration-alert-actions-menu.png"
            alt="Iteration on the alert actions' menu."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">Iteration on the alert actions' menu.</p>

          <p>
            This iteration was designed to test the option of not investing on
            any search, filter or sort capabilities, however given that the
            engineering effort was small and the amount of alerts was expected
            to be low, this iteration was discarted.
          </p>

            src="./images/iteration-list-of-alerts-before-search-filter.png"

          <p class="foot-note">
            Iteration of a version without any search, filter or sort
            capabilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            In an effort to explore ideas around the main metaphore of alerts,
            one idea early on was to enable a snooze option assuming the system
            would somehow insist on it if the behavior continued. Together with
            the AI team we determined that creating too much noice may reduce
            the confidence from the CISO, therefore increasing the possibilities
            of turning off the alerts altogether.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name of the tab was also names originally "Alerts", but during
            user testing we discovered that some people assumed that all alert
            notifications would be located there, but the new view was only
            available for the CISO, so the final name for this version was
            "CISO".
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/iteration-options-swippe.png"
            alt="Iteration of swipe to see option to snooze alert."

          <p class="foot-note">
            Iteration of swipe to see option to snooze alert.
          </p>

          <h4>Final solution</h4>
          <p>
            Apart from the push notification, we also used the count on the
            badge to show the number of unread alerts, to let the user know that
            there is something unread ready for her to see any time.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/final-badge-app-icon.png"
            alt="Final design of badge count on app icon refering to unread alerts."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">
            Final design of badge count on app icon refering to unread alerts.
          </p>

          <p>
            The final design is a list of alerts ordered by more recent on the
            top, each alert has some details, a signal to indicate if unread.
            The shortcut to mark as unread is to give quick access in the case
            that is clearly a false alarm, in the contrary case, and the alert
            is clearly real, the shortcut to share the info is useful.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/final-list-of alerts-swipe-actions.png"
            alt="Final design of list of alerts and swipe actions."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">
            Final design of list of alerts and swipe actions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Given that the data was very consistent for this version, the search
            box could filter by name or location directly typing, the only
            filter needed was to show or hide archived alerts. The results had
            the same indication of unread if applied and the actions' menu to
            access any function available. This pattern on the search results is
            the same used on other views of the mobile UI.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/final-search-alerts.png"
            alt="Final design for search alerts."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">Final design for search alerts.</p>

          <p>
            The alert menu included the options to mark or unmark as unread to
            manage items similarly to email messages on the Mail tab, to archive
            alerts for false positives, to share the details using 3rd party
            apps or the built-in Mail function. This same menu is available from
            the Alert details page.
          </p>

            alt="Final design of alert actions' menu."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">Final design of alert actions' menu.</p>

          <p>
            The alert details' page showed all there is to know about the alert
            and offers all the available actions mentioned before. The idea is
            to pressent enough and clear information for the CISO to determine
            if the alert represent a valid risk and if that's the case to get in
            contact and share the details about the alert.

          <h4>Success metrics</h4>
          <p>
            The feature itself had a crucial success metric that affected UX,
            but it was out of my control, the relevancy of the alert, the fact
            that the information expressed the signal and removed the noice.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design had the same success metrics as other projects, to be
            intuitive, useful and most importantly to ship on time.
          </p>
          <h4>Learnings</h4>
          <p>
            Personally, I learned about alerts from the perspective of UX and AI
            patterns, such as the signal to noice ratio or the push
            notification.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a team, we were able to release the first of its kind and
            validate the idea of the offer to CISOs, this helped open many
            conversations with current customers about the types of alerts they
            specific organization migh be interested on.
          </p>
          <h4>Future iterations</h4>
          <p>
            Other alerts for different types of behaviors followed and are
            expected to continue to be added using the same framework to manage,
            consume and share the alert details.
