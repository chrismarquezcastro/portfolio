          <p>
            People in the CISO role (Chief Information Security Officer) care
            for one thing above else to protect the organization assets from
            getting on the wrong hands or destroyed. However, if something were
            to happen, it's vital to alert them about potential risks and
            present accurate and valuable information with urgency.
          </p>
          <h4>Product definition</h4>
          <p>
            The main goal is to reach the CISO with urgency to present the
            relevant information and to enable the option to share this alert,
            knowing that the mobile device is the one that people check more
            often and even has ways to push notifications, so we could asume the
            CISO would look into it shortly.

          <!-- Brainstorming -->
          <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
          <p>
            There was a long brainstorming process early on, when determining
            the alert behavior, however when the project reached the mobile
            implementation it was more or less defined already.
          </p>
          <p>
            The implementation of the alerts on the mobile app is an extension
            of a feature I collaborated with before; the information displayed
            was the result from ongoing discussions with stakeholders about the
            meaning of risk in an enviroment such as the Kiteworks platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mobile design had to adapt a new view that would only be
            available for some types of users; fortunatelly, the primary mobile
            navigation had been recently simplified, so this wasn't a problem.
          </p>

          <!-- User research -->
          <h4>User research</h4>
          <p>
            Based on the hypothesis, the team met with internal and external
            stakeholders, such as the CEO and other excecutives, as well as some
            customers that shown interest in these types of tools before; the
            goal early on was to get insights into their motivations,
            expectations and later on to validate versions of the prototype.
          </p>

          <!-- Problem / Solution validation -->
          <h4>Problem / Solution validation</h4>
          <p>
            The primary question we had was the types of risks that they were
            aware of and how they would like to get notified. Then, the
            questions were more about the alert we had in mind to qualify its
            merit according to this user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we had an initial prototype a cycle of quick critique sessions
            with different and relevant stakeholders took place to evolve the
            design to its final state.
          </p>

          <!-- Team alignment -->
          <h4>Team alignment</h4>
          <p>
            I served as the link between the team working on the AI to detect
            alerts and the teams working on the mobile apps. Meeting regularly
            with both teams helped everyone to be on the same page.
          </p>
          <p>
            The spec documentation and the prototype help bring everything and
            everyone together, giving everyone access to the design and the
            ability to ask questions and make comments.

          <h4>Explorations</h4>
          <p>
            To streamline the information to the user and allow her to act on
            that information, we thought about adding a button to share.
            However, after testing with internal stakeholders, we discovered
            that the user needs to see the alert's full details before deciding
            to share.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/draft-notification-options.png"
            alt="Idea of expand push notification for options, to see details or share alert."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">
            Idea of expand push notification for options, to see details or
            share alert.
          </p>

          <p>
            When capturing the details that the alert needed to contain,
            including the metadata, it was clear that some repetition could be
            avoided. We also got feedback about a better display of the location
            to understand where the alert was triggered.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/draft-alert-details.png"
            alt="Idea of full alert details including the files that triggered the alert."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">
            Idea of full alert details including the files that triggered the
            alert.
          </p>

          <p>
            This design shows a dedicated text search field to narrow down
            search results to create the tools for the user to find alerts
            quickly. It turns out that after some testing with internal
            stakeholders, we realized that the number of warnings was going to
            be small and the frequency sparse, so a single search filter was
            enough.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/draft-search-alerts.png"
            alt="Idea of search and filter alerts."

          <p class="foot-note">Idea of search and filter alerts.</p>

          <h4>Iterations</h4>
          <p>
            The idea of filtering as an end goal was correct, so we explored
            ways to simplify the ability to see the query and the filters
            without the clutter of the three text boxes. We did not investigate
            further, given that more alerts would take time to develop and
            nothing complicated would be needed at that moment.
          </p>

            alt="Iteration on the search alerts interaction."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">Iteration on the search alerts interaction.</p>

          <p>
            When thinking about the options for each alert in the context of
            risk management, we explored the type of actions that the CISO would
            want to take on the user who triggered the alerts; however, given
            that the level of confidence can't be determined on the alerts, we
            decided not to expand on these ideas for the moment.
          </p>
          <img

            alt="Iteration on the alert actions' menu."
          />
          <p class="foot-note">Iteration on the alert actions' menu.</p>

          <p>
            This iteration was designed to test the option of not investing in
            any search, filter, or sort capabilities; however, given that the
            engineering effort was small and the number of alerts was expected
            to be low, this iteration was discarded.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/iteration-list-of-alerts-before-search-filter.png"
            alt="Iteration of a version without any search, filter or sort capabilities."

          <p class="foot-note">
            Iteration of a version without any search, filter or sort
            capabilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            To explore ideas around the central metaphor of alerts, one idea
            early on was to enable a snooze option assuming the system would
            somehow insist on it if the behavior continued. Together with the AI
            team, we determined that creating too much noise may reduce the
            confidence of the CISO, therefore increasing the possibility of
            turning off the alerts altogether.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tab's name was initially "Alerts". However, we discovered that
            some people assumed that all alert notifications would be located
            there. Given that the new view was only available for the CISO, the
            final name for this version was "CISO".
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/iteration-options-swippe.png"
            alt="Iteration of swipe to see option to snooze alert."

          <p class="foot-note">
            Iteration of swipe to see option to snooze alert.
          </p>

          <h4>Final solution</h4>
          <p>
            Apart from the push notification, we also used the count on the
            badge to show the number of unread alerts to let the user know that
            there is something unread ready for her to see.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./images/final-badge-app-icon.png"
            alt="Final design of badge count on app icon refering to unread alerts."

          <p class="foot-note">
            Final design of badge count on app icon refering to unread alerts.
          </p>

          <p>
            The final design is a list of alerts ordered by more recent on the
            top; each attention has some details and a signal to indicate if
            unread. The shortcut to mark as unread is to give quick access in
            the case of a false alarm; in the contrary case, and the alert is
            accurate, the shortcut to share the info is helpful.
          </p>

          <p class="foot-note">
            Final design of list of alerts and swipe actions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Given that the data was very consistent for this version, the search
            box could filter by name or location by directly typing; the only
            filter needed was to show or hide archived alerts. The results had
            the exact indication of unread if applied and the actions' menu to
            access any function available. This pattern on the search results is
            the same used on other views of the mobile UI.
          </p>

          <p class="foot-note">Final design for search alerts.</p>

          <p>
            The alert menu included the options to mark or unmark as unread to
            manage items similarly to email messages on the Mail tab, archive
            alerts for false positives, share the details using 3rd party apps,
            or the built-in Mail function. This same menu is available from the
            Alert details page.

          <p>
            The alert's details page showed all there is to know about the alert
            and offered all the available actions mentioned before. The idea is
            to present enough clear information for the CISO to determine if the
            alert represents a valid risk, and, if that's the case, please get
            in touch and share the details about the alert.

          <h4>Success metrics</h4>
          <p>
            The feature itself had a crucial success metric that affected UX,
            but it was out of my control, the relevancy of the alert, the fact
            that the information expressed the signal, and ignored the noise.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design had the same success metrics as other projects, to be
            intuitive, helpful, and most importantly, to ship on time.
          </p>
          <h4>Learnings</h4>
          <p>
            I learned about alerts from the perspective of UX and AI patterns,
            such as the signal-to-noise ratio or the push notification.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a team, we were able to release the first of its kind and
            validate the idea of the offer to CISOs; this helped start many
            conversations with current customers about the types of alerts
            specific organizations might be interested in.
          </p>
          <h4>Future iterations</h4>
          <p>
            Other alerts for different behaviors followed and are expected to
            continue to be added using the same framework to manage, consume and
            share the alert details.
