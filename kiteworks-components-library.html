            Designers needed a library of components to be reused every time
            they wanted to design for a workflow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developers needed a library of components in all their states to
            build an exact replica of those components, so that it can be
            re-used thoughout the product graphical user interfaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            The branding guidelines had been recently updated and the product
            look and feel should leverage those guidelines.
          </p>
          <h4>Product definition</h4>
          <p>
            Kiteworks is a whitelabel B2B platform that can be partially
            re-branded without affectinig accessibility. Being a white-label
            product implies the neutrality and simplicity to harmonize with any
            brand look and feel or to be used out of the box without any
            customization.
          </p>
          <p>
            A project to improve the user experience of the admin console will
            serve as the first product to be built using the new components'
            library.
          </p>
          <p>
            The components design will be leveraged from the existing look and
            feel of the end user UI, given its adoption in recent years.
